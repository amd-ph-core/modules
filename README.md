## Using existing modules

The module files hosted in this repository define a set of processes for software tools such as `varpipe/coverageanalysis`, `picard/buildbamindex`, `gatk4/mutect2`, etc. This allows you to share and add common functionality across multiple pipelines in a modular fashion.

We use the `nf-core/tools` package with a custom `--git-remote` to manage modules from this repository. This includes using `git` commit hashes to track changes for reproducibility purposes, and to download and install all of the relevant module files.

1. Install the latest version of [`nf-core/tools`](https://github.com/nf-core/tools#installation) (`>=2.0`)
2. List the available modules:

   ```console
   nf-core modules --git-remote https://github.com/amd-ph-core/modules.git list remote
   ```

3. Install a module in your pipeline directory:

   ```console
   nf-core modules --git-remote https://github.com/amd-ph-core/modules.git install varpipe/coverageanalysis
   ```

4. Import the module in your Nextflow script:

   ```nextflow
   #!/usr/bin/env nextflow

   nextflow.enable.dsl = 2

   include { VARPIPE_COVERAGEANALYSIS } from './modules/amd-ph-core/varpipe/coverageanalysis/main'
   ```

5. Remove a module from the pipeline repository:

   ```console
   nf-core modules --git-remote https://github.com/amd-ph-core/modules.git remove varpipe/coverageanalysis
   ```

6. Check that a locally installed module is up-to-date:

   ```console
   nf-core modules --git-remote https://github.com/amd-ph-core/modules.git lint varpipe/coverageanalysis
   ```

## Available modules

### Contamination control

### BAM processing

- `picard/buildbamindex` - Build BAM index
- `picard/samformatconverter` - Convert between SAM/BAM formats
- `picard/sortsam` - Sort SAM/BAM files

### TB varpipe analysis

- `varpipe/bwamem` - BWA-MEM alignment for TB variant pipeline
- `varpipe/coverageanalysis` - Coverage statistics

## Available subworkflows

- `fastq_clockwork_decontaminate` - Read decontamination using Clockwork
- `varpipe_core` - Top-level TB varpipe analysis workflow
- `varpipe_processbam` - BAM processing for varpipe (sort, index, mark duplicates)

> **Note:** The tbvarpipe pipeline also uses standard modules from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) (e.g., `bwa/index`, `samtools/*`, `gatk4/*`, `snpeff/snpeff`, `trimmomatic`, `cat/fastq`, `multiqc`). Those are installed separately via `nf-core modules install`.
